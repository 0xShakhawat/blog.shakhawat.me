…and I work for Cyber Security Research.

People find me enthusiastic and friendly. Sharing knowledge is my passion. My biggest strength is – I am a quick self-learner. Computer technology is my play ground. I’m a programmer and content creator. I am compassionate, I can put myself in others’ shoes. Having this ability gave me a whole new perspective to look at things.

I prefer giving over taking. They say that I have a good sense of humor too. In case you are wondering, my personality type is “INFP” (Google it, if you don’t know what that means). And, one last thing, I love my family more than anything.
